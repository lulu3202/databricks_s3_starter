## Account Access
Q: I can't log into my account, what should I do?

## Data Pipeline Issues

A: Check the pipeline logs in your dashboard. Common issues include: insufficient permissions, data format mismatches, or network connectivity problems.

## Performance Issues
Q: Why is my query running slowly?
A: Slow queries can be caused by: large dataset size, missing indexes, inefficient query structure, or resource constraints. Try optimizing your query or upgrading your plan.
